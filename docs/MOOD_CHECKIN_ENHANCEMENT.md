# Mood Check-in Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented mood check-in prompts in broadcast system to increase user engagement and improve recovery tracking.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Service (`src/services/user_service.py`)
**New Methods Added:**
- `has_checked_in_today(user_id)` - Check if user has done mood check-in today
- `get_users_without_checkin_today()` - Get list of users who haven't checked in
- `record_mood_checkin(user_id, mood_score, ...)` - Record mood check-in data

### 2. New MoodEntry Database Model (`src/database/models.py`)
**Fields Added:**
- `mood_score` (1-10 scale)
- `energy_level` (optional 1-10)
- `stress_level` (optional 1-10)
- `sleep_quality` (optional 1-10)
- `urge_intensity` (optional 1-10)
- `notes` (optional text)
- Timestamps for tracking

### 3. Mood Check-in Keyboards (`src/bot/keyboards/inline_keyboards.py`)
**New Keyboard Methods:**
- `mood_checkin_menu()` - 1-10 mood scale selection
- `mood_details_menu()` - Additional tracking options
- `quick_mood_response()` - Quick 3-button response for broadcasts

### 4. Mood Check-in Handlers (`src/bot/handlers/mood_checkin_handlers.py`)
**Complete Handler System:**
- `handle_mood_checkin_start()` - Start check-in process
- `handle_mood_selection()` - Process mood score selection
- `handle_quick_mood_response()` - Quick response from broadcasts
- `handle_detailed_checkin()` - Full detailed check-in
- `handle_skip_mood_today()` - Skip check-in option
- `handle_finish_checkin()` - Complete and save check-in

**Features:**
- Emoji-based mood feedback (üò¢ to üåü)
- Contextual messages based on mood score
- Comprehensive mood tracking with multiple dimensions
- Integration with existing streak system

### 5. Enhanced Broadcast Service (`src/services/broadcast_service.py`)
**New Features:**
- `_send_personalized_broadcast()` - Personalized messages with mood prompts
- Automatic detection of users without daily check-in
- Dynamic keyboard based on check-in status
- Maintains all existing broadcast content (quotes, tips, facts, etc.)

**Broadcast Enhancement:**
- Users who haven't checked in get mood prompt in broadcast
- Quick check-in buttons added to broadcast messages
- Encouraging messages to maintain consistency
- Preserves streak tracking regardless of mood check-in

### 6. Callback Handler Integration (`src/bot/handlers/callback_handlers.py`)
**New Routes Added:**
- `quick_mood_checkin` ‚Üí Start quick mood check-in
- `detailed_mood_checkin` ‚Üí Start detailed check-in
- `mood_score_*` ‚Üí Handle mood score selection
- `quick_mood_*` ‚Üí Handle quick responses from broadcasts
- `skip_mood_today` ‚Üí Skip mood tracking for today
- `finish_mood_checkin` ‚Üí Complete check-in process

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User Receives Daily Broadcast (Not Checked In)
1. **Enhanced Broadcast Message** includes:
   - Regular daily content (quote, tip, facts, inspiration)
   - Mood check-in prompt with explanation
   - Quick check-in buttons: "üå°Ô∏è Quick Check-in" and "üìù Detail Check-in"

2. **Quick Check-in Flow:**
   - User clicks "Quick Check-in"
   - Gets 1-10 mood scale with emojis
   - Selects mood ‚Üí Gets personalized feedback
   - Check-in recorded, streak continues

3. **Detailed Check-in Flow:**
   - User clicks "Detail Check-in"
   - Mood scale selection
   - Optional additional metrics (energy, stress, sleep, urges)
   - Optional notes
   - Comprehensive feedback and saving

### Scenario 2: User Already Checked In Today
- Broadcast includes regular content only
- No mood prompts (avoids spam)
- Focus on other engagement (goals, progress, tools)

### Scenario 3: Manual Mood Check-in
- Available through main menu
- Same detailed flow as broadcast-initiated
- Prevents duplicate check-ins
- Shows encouraging message if already done

## Technical Architecture

### Database Integration
```python
# MoodEntry model links to User
class MoodEntry(Base):
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))
    mood_score = Column(Integer, nullable=False)  # 1-10
    energy_level = Column(Integer)  # Optional 1-10
    # ... other fields
```

### Broadcast Logic Enhancement
```python
# Enhanced broadcast with mood detection
users_without_checkin = self.user_service.get_users_without_checkin_today()
for user in users:
    needs_mood_checkin = user.telegram_id in [u.telegram_id for u in users_without_checkin]
    await self._send_personalized_broadcast(user.telegram_id, content, needs_mood_checkin)
```

### Handler Integration
```python
# Seamless integration with existing callback system
elif callback_data == "quick_mood_checkin":
    await mood_checkin_handlers.handle_mood_checkin_start(update, context)
```
